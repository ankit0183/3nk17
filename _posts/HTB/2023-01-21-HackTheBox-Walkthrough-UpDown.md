It took me a long time to get a foothold on that machine. But once I was in, getting the user and root was very easy.

* Room: UpDown
* Difficulty: Medium

## Enumeration

As always, I started by running Rustscan to find open ports.

```bash
$ rustscan -a target -- -v | tee rust.txt
.----. .-. .-. .----..---.  .----. .---.   .--.  .-. .-.
| {}  }| { } |{ {__ {_   _}{ {__  /  ___} / {} \ |  `| |
| .-. \| {_} |.-._} } | |  .-._} }\     }/  /\  \| |\  |
`-' `-'`-----'`----'  `-'  `----'  `---' `-'  `-'`-' `-'

Ports 22 (SSH) and 80 (HTTP) were open.

## Website

The website allowed checking if a website was up or not. 

![WebSite](/assets/images/UpDown/UpDownSite.png "WebSite")

There was also a debug feature that showed the HTML returned by the site being checked.

![Debug On](/assets/images/UpDown/SiteUpWithDebug.png "Debug On")

When I saw the debug feature, I thought I could use it to do [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf). I tried to use it to check for ports that were only available on the server.

```bash
$ wfuzz -z range,1-65535 -d "site=http://localhost:FUZZ&debug=1" --hw 99  http://target.htb

It did not find anything. I launched Feroxbuster to look for hidden pages.

The dev folder contained a `.git` folder. So I used [git-dumper](https://github.com/arthaud/git-dumper) to extract it.

This hinted at a possible development site. It did not appear to be in `/dev` so I looked for subdomains.

```bash

It found `dev.siteisup.htb`, I added that to my hosts files. When I tried to visit it, I got a 403.

I looked at the .htaccess from the source code and saw that the site required a header to be present.

```
SetEnvIfNoCase Special-Dev "only4dev" Required-Header
Order Deny,Allow
Deny from All
Allow from env=Required-Header
```

I used Burp Proxy Map and Replace to always had that header to my requests.

![Burp Add Header](/assets/images/UpDown/BurpAddHeader.png "Burp Add Header")

I reloaded the page, and this time I got a 200.

![Dev Site](/assets/images/UpDown/DevSite.png "Dev Site")

This site was also checking if websites were online or not. But this one allowed uploading files with a list of sites to check.

There was also an admin panel. 

![Admin Panel](/assets/images/UpDown/AdminPanel.png "Admin Panel")

The panel was empty, but the `?page=admin` in the URL hinted at [Local File Inclusion (LFI)](https://www.acunetix.com/blog/articles/local-file-inclusion-lfi/). 

The source code confirmed it was possible.

```php
<?php
	define("DIRECTACCESS",false);
	$page=$_GET['page'];
	if($page && !preg_match("/bin|usr|home|var|etc/i",$page)){
		include($_GET['page'] . ".php");
	}else{
		include("checker.php");
	}	
?>
```

There were some limitations, but I could include PHP files.

I thought that I might be able to use the file upload functionality to upload a PHP file, then execute it with LFI vulnerability. But it was not that simple. The upload had some restrictions on the file extensions, PHP files were rejected. And it was deleting the uploaded files as soon as it was done.

```php
if($_POST['check']){
  
	# File size must be less than 10kb.
	if ($_FILES['file']['size'] > 10000) {
        die("File too large!");
    }
	$file = $_FILES['file']['name'];
	
	# Check if extension is allowed.
	$ext = getExtension($file);
	if(preg_match("/php|php[0-9]|html|py|pl|phtml|zip|rar|gz|gzip|tar/i",$ext)){
		die("Extension not allowed!");
	}
  
	# Create directory to upload our file.
	$dir = "uploads/".md5(time())."/";
	if(!is_dir($dir)){
        mkdir($dir, 0770, true);
    }
  
  # Upload the file.
	$final_path = $dir.$file;
	move_uploaded_file($_FILES['file']['tmp_name'], "{$final_path}");
	
  # Read the uploaded file.
	$websites = explode("\n",file_get_contents($final_path));
	
	foreach($websites as $site){
		$site=trim($site);
		if(!preg_match("#file://#i",$site) && !preg_match("#data://#i",$site) && !preg_match("#ftp://#i",$site)){
			$check=isitup($site);
			if($check){
				echo "<center>{$site}<br><font color='green'>is up ^_^</font></center>";
			}else{
				echo "<center>{$site}<br><font color='red'>seems to be down :(</font></center>";
			}	
		}else{
			echo "<center><font color='red'>Hacking attempt was detected !</font></center>";
		}
	}
	
  # Delete the uploaded file.
	@unlink($final_path);
}
```

It was also uploading files to a different folder every time. Luckily, directory listing was not disabled on the uploads folder, so I did not need to guess the folders where my files were being uploaded. I also did not need to use the LFI to execute PHP code if I were to find a way to upload a PHP file.

The deleting of the file could have been an issue, but I quickly found a way around that.

```php
function isitup($url){
	$ch=curl_init();
	curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, trim($url));
	curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_USERAGENT, "siteisup.htb beta");
	curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HEADER, 1);
	curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION, 1);
	curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1);
	curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST, 0);
	curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, 0);
	curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_TIMEOUT, 30);
	$f = curl_exec($ch);
	$header = curl_getinfo($ch);
	if($f AND $header['http_code'] == 200){
		return array(true,$f);
	}else{
		return false;
	}
    curl_close($ch);
}
```

The code was using Curl to check if the websites were up. And it had a 30 seconds timeout. Hack The Box machines do not have access to the internet, so if I tried to check on any sites, it would hang for 30 seconds before deleting the file. I could add more lines if I needed more time.

![Persisted File](/assets/images/2023/01/UpDown/PersitedFile.png "Persited File")

The code was blocking PHP files. But PHP [supports many extensions](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/file-upload#file-upload-general-methodology). I found out I could upload `.phar` files and they were executed.

![RCE](/assets/images/2023/01/UpDown/RCE.png "RCE")

At this point, I thought I had an easy reverse shell.

```

I sent a phar file with the reverse shell and opened it, but it failed. I tried different reverse shells, they all failed.

I changed my code to execute `phpinfo()`. This showed me why my reverse shells were all failing.

![Disabled Functions](/assets/images/2023/01/UpDown/DisabledFunctions.png "Disabled Functions")

The functions I was using to get the shell were all disabled by PHP configuration. I tried to use `ini_set` to enable them. But they cannot be enabled at runtime.

I tried other things, I used PHP to list the files and folders on the machine. I tried reading many files but did not find anything. I tried reading the user's ssh key but did not have access. I got stuck at this point. I left the machine aside and worked on others for a while. 


## Finally a Shell

When I came back to this box, I tried to bypass the disabled functions again. I tried a few things I found, but none of them worked. 

I came across a [Python script](https://github.com/teambi0s/dfunc-bypasser) that took the output of `phpinfo()` and checked for functions that are not disabled and can be exploited. The code failed to parse the list of functions. It's 3 years old and the format might have changed. I hardcoded the list of functions directly in the code and ran it.

```bash
$ python2 dfunc-bypasser.py --url http://dev.siteisup.htb/uploads/test.php


                                ,---,

                                  ,---.'     \  
                                  |   |  .`\  |

                                  '   | ;  .  | 
                                  |   | :  |  '

                                  ;   :  .'     
                                  |   ,.'       
                                  '---'

Please add the following functions in your disable_functions option: 
proc_open
If PHP-FPM is there stream_socket_sendto,stream_socket_client,fsockopen can also be used to be exploit by poisoning the request to the unix socket
```

`proc_open` was not disabled. I found a [small script](https://github.com/Taintedtrickstr/Reverse_Shells/blob/main/PHP_Proc_Open_Reverse_Shell) that showed how to exploit it to run commands on the server. 


I used it to get a shell on the server.

## Getting User

Once I got in the machine, I looked for files with the `suid` bit set.

There was an executable in developer's home that I could run as them.

The executable seemed to be using a python script to check if a site was up. The script was using `input` to get the URL to check. Python 2 has a [known vulnerability](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/vulnerability-input-function-python-2-x/) in input. I used it to copy developer's ssh key where I could read it.

```bash

Escalating to root was very easy. I checked if I could run anything with `sudo`. 

```bash

    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User developer may run the following commands on localhost:
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/easy_install

    sys.argv[0] = re.sub(r'(-script\.pyw|\.exe)?$', '', sys.argv[0])
    sys.exit(main())
```

I searched for exploits in [easy_install](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/key_projects/#easy-install) and found one on [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/easy_install/) that created a fake local package with code executed on installation.

## Mitigations

I found the initial foothold on that box very hard. There were some security measures in place to make it harder to pwn. But it still had some issues that could be easily fixed. 

The `.git` folder should never be deployed with a site. Having access to the source code helped me find things I could exploit.

The file upload functionality had a few issues. 
* The upload folder should not allow directory listing
* Uploaded files should be renamed
* The upload folder should have been outside the webroot
* The list of extensions should have been an allowed list instead of a denied list

The disabled functions were great. This is what gave me a really hard time on that box. But it took only one missing function to allow access to the box. It shows that file upload is a very dangerous feature.

The issue with the Python script can be fixed by using `raw_input` instead of `input`. And the executable should probably not have the `suid` bit set.

As for `easy_install`, it is deprecated. So it should probably not be used. And it should not be run as root. Developers should install their dependencies as themselves.
