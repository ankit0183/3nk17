    "content": "2022-03-21 - TRAFFIC ANALYSIS EXERCISE - BURNINCANDLESCENARIOExercise LinkZip archive of the pcap: 2022-03-21-traffic-analysis-exercise.pcap.zip 4.9 MB (4,942,730 bytes)LAN segment data:  LAN segment range: 10.0.19.0/24 (10.0.19.0 through 10.0.19.255)  Domain: burnincandle.com  Domain controller: 10.0.19.9 - BURNINCANDLE-DC  LAN segment gateway: 10.0.19.1  LAN segment broadcast address: 10.0.19.255TASK  Write an incident report based on the pcap.  The incident report should contains 3 sections:          Executive Summary: State in simple, direct terms what happened (when, who, what).      Details: Details of the victim (hostname, IP address, MAC address, Windows user account name).      Indicators of Compromise (IOCs): IP addresses, domains and URLs associated with the infection. SHA256 hashes if any malware binaries can be extracted from the pcap.      üß† Thought Process üß†We have been provided details regarding the clients LAN segment to investigate what transpired. So far we have the Domain info, DC, Gateway and Broadcast IP addresses. A quick way to find other hosts on the network would be too look at the endpoint summary. ( Statistics &gt; Endpoints)We get 10.0.19.14 , and judging by the number of packets, this could be the target we‚Äôre interested in. Lets find more info about the host. Using dhcp as my display filter, and inspecting the DHCP Request frame in the packet details pane, we get information that we need. i.e,  Client MAC address: PERIPHER_b7:33:0f (00:60:52:b7:33:0f)  Requested IP Address: 10.0.19.14  Host Name: DESKTOP-5QS3D5D  Client name: DESKTOP-5QS3D5D.burnincandle.comWe also need to find the User account name of this host. Since the IP is co-joined to a domain (burnincandle.com), we can confirm if we have some kerberos related packets by looking at the protocol hiererachy statistics.( Statistics &gt; Protocol Hiererachy)  Kerberos is a protocol for authenticating service requests between trusted hosts across an untrusted network, such as the internet.Yeeep, we do. With this in mind, since we know the DC ip, we can throw in a filter like ip.addr == 10.0.19.14 &amp;&amp; ip.addr == 10.0.19.9 &amp;&amp; kerberos.CNameString and !(kerberos.CNameString contains $) to only display packets containing the CNameString field.  cname: this section holds the username the client is trying to authenticate. To be more specific, the exact username in this case is ‚Äúpatrick.zimmerman‚Äù  Please note that the CNameString Column isnt there by default. I added it manually as shown:Also, another quick way to find such information, you can use NetworkMiner , an open source Network Forensic Analysis Tool (NFAT).IOC‚ÄôsWe can then start looking for any IOCs and try figure out what happened. Looking at HTTP related traffic, we see the victim machine made contact with a suspicious host : oceriesfornot.top on dst IP : 188.166.154.118I did a lookup on the two hosts : x1.c.lencr.org &amp; ctldl.windowsupdate.com and they seem to legitimately belong to LetsEncrypt &amp; Microsoft respectively. However, oceriesfornot.top looks like its affliated to the Quantum RansomwareSelecting the frame and following TCP stream, we get an interesting cookie :Spent sometime researching more on the same and got a hit on sysopfb‚Äôs blog where he does some RE on IcedID malware that contained a similar cookie.He explains that the _u cookie value holds the victims username and computername hexlified. So i used cyberchef to confirm this and indeed we get: DESKTOP-5QS3D5D:patrick.zimmerman:CD2F3B9F67E3C343Other values have been summarized in the table below:            Cookie      Value                  _gid      Based on physical address of NIC              _io      Domain identifier from SID              _u      Username and Computername              _gat      Windows version info              _ga      Processor info via CPUID including hypervisor brand if available              _gads      First DWORD from decoded config data, flag from inspecting server certificate, a random DWORD or number passed as parameter with -id=, number of processes      Something else we notice here is the victim seems to be getting a gzip file from the suspicious IP. I used NetworkMiner to extract it.However, VT didnt pick this up as malicious.I tried to do some manual analysis on the file and see what i could find but i guess i hit the wall üò©. Back to research , i found out that IcedID uses this technique as the first stage loading mechanism. The Binary Defense Threat Hunting team have a nice technical blog on the IcedID GZIPLOADER . i‚Äôd suggest having a look at it.üòâSimply put, IcedID‚Äôs gziploader infection chain looks like this:~Source: Binary Defense BlogI then proceeded to my third tool, Brim Security to query the packets further. In this case i‚Äôm interested in seeing DNS queries with the most counts or suspicious names.Cleaning this up abit we get the queries and responses.Now back to wireshark and filtering for dns.a we get 3 other unique query responses, 2 happening in a span of a second. Whats also unique is that both are file sharing websites.Applying 23.227.198.203 (bupdater.com) as my destination address, i noticed a pattern. Every minute the host seems to beacon/communicate with bupdater[.]com on port 757. C2 traffic? Potential exfiltration? C2 heartbeat activity? Lets find out.Doing a lookup on VirusTotal , i found several other people having reported it as a Cobalt Strike C2 Server.Enumeration.Net (net.exe) commands are often used by attackers and insiders to enumerate target network information, change passwords, and create users. Monitoring for MS-SAMR related activities, allows us to detect and respond to this behavior that is often an important part of attacks such as ransomware.  MS-SAMR (Security Account Manager (SAM) Remote Protocol) supports management functionality for an account store or directory containing users and groups. The goal of the protocol is to enable IT administrators and users to manage users, groups, and computers.On wireshark, we can filter for this protocol by using samr as our display filter. But for learning purposes, lets first understand the basic flow of the SAMR protocol. (See screenshot below)            Shortly after our victim is done communicating with 157.245.142.66 , we can see SMB connections from the victim to the DC.                  The second phase is to connect to the IPC$ share on the remote machine. The IPC$ share as you might already know, is used for Inter Proces Communication by using RPC over SMB to allow clients to send different commands to the server to listen users, shares, etc.                  The third phase is to open the SAMR named pipe.                  Fourth phase is to connect to the SAMR interface, which can be recognized by its UUID: 12345778-1234-abcd-ef00-0123456789ac as shown below.      Just to make things cleaner moving on, i applied the samr filter to get commands and queries executed. The first two packets, Connect5 request &amp; Connect5 response tends to obtains a handle to a server object. What follows next is abit interesting though.The attacker seems to be enumerating the Domain, Groups, RIDS etc. Here is a summary of all methods i extracted at the end of my analysis:  EnumDomains - is used to obtain a listing of all domains hosted by the server-side of the protocol.  LookupDomain - uses the established context handle to return the SID of a domain object, given the object‚Äôs name obtained from the EnumerateDomains method.  OpenDomain - obtains a handle to a domain object, using the SID returned by the previous LookupDomain method.  LookupNames - translates a set of account names into a set of RIDs.  OpenGroup - obtains a handle to a domain object, given a SID.  QueryGroupInfo  QueryGroupMember - will query all the members that are part of Domain Admin but will only display the RID.  LookupRids - Shows the account name of each RID that is a member of Domain Admins.  OpenUser - obtains a handle to a user, given a RID.  QueryUserInfo - obtains attributes from a user object using the user object handle  QuerySecurity  GetGroupsForUser - obtains a listing of groups that a user is a member of.  GetAliasMembership - obtains the union of all aliases that a given set of SIDs is a member of.Sample information gathered about the target and target domain:Summary of IOC‚Äôs collected:Domains and IP addresses for IcedID (Bokbot):            Domain      IP                  oceriesfornot[.]top      188.166.154.118              antnosience[.]com      157.245.142.66              suncoastpinball[.]com      160.153.32.99              otectagain[.]top      157.245.142.66              seaskysafe[.]com      91.193.16.181              dilimoretast[.]com      160.153.32.99      Suspicious traffic to file sharing domains:            Domain      IP                  filebin[.]net      185.47.40.36              situla[.]bitbit[.]net      87.238.33.8 , 87.238.33.7      Domains and IP addresses for Cobalt Strike:            Domain      IP      Port                  bupdater[.]com      23.227.198.203      757      ConclusionI had so much fun analyzing this PCAP, and learnt much on the fly. I would definately recommend checking out Brad Duncan‚Äôs Blog. It‚Äôs really a great resource for packet capture (pcap) files and malware samples. While you are at it, consider giving him a follow on twitter @malware_traffic for any updates.If anyone has additional details that i might have missed, or has any feedback to improve my methodology it would be greatly appreciated.Resources  Wireshark Tutorial: Identifying Hosts and Users  Taming Kerberos and making it our loyal companion  IcedID PhotoLoader evolution  IcedID GZIPLOADER Analysis  MS-SAMR: Security Account Manager (SAM) Remote Protocol (Client-to-Server) doumentation  Detecting Security Events Using the MS-SAMR Protocol  Analyzing network packets with Wireshark ‚Äì AD and User Enumeration"

    "content": "Hey all and welcome once more to my blog. This past weekend i had the privilege to create a forensics challenge for the CyberCon Finals CTF which was held at USIU University. Top 4 Proffesional teams and 10 University teams battled out different challenges ranging from: Web, Forensics, Pwn, Reverse Engineering. Anyway, i didn‚Äôt have enough time to properly setup a challenge from scratch, so i resolved to create some questions on a memory sample containing some nasty backdoor i was analyzing sometime back. I was happy to see folks solve most of the challenges and almost comming to the same conclusion i had before. With that said, i will be sharing my thought process on how the challenges were meant to be solved.So, what is a memory dump? Simply put, a memory dump (also known as a core dump or system dump) is a snapshot capture of computer memory data from a specific instant. A memory dump can contain valuable forensics data about the state of the system before an incident such as a crash or security compromise.  Memory forensics can provide unique insights into runtime system activity, including open network connections and recently executed commands or processes. In many cases, critical data pertaining to attacks or threats will exist solely in system memory ‚Äì examples include network connections, account credentials, chat messages, encryption keys, running processes, injected code fragments, and internet history which is non-cacheable. Any program ‚Äì malicious or otherwise ‚Äì must be loaded in memory in order to execute, making memory forensics critical for identifying otherwise obfuscated attacks. ~Source: DigitalGuardianFirst, you unzip the provided memory sample. Password: infectedTo answer the first question, you were only required to get the md5sum of the .vmem file. This was as easy as:‚ûú  md5sum malware.vmemcb47af710c7ab59e43d1396aa7ce950c  malware.vmemMoving on, we can use a tool like volatility to analyze the memory dump.Other tools you can explore on memory forensics include:  Rekall Framework  RedlineFirst, you need to find more information about the dump you are analying such as the image profile to use.

My thinking, The user probably opened a malicious pdf file that spawned cmd and finally Adobe reader to view it. We can use the cmdscan plugin to extract command history as shown:‚ûú  python2 vol.py -f malware.vmem --profile=WinXPSP2x86 cmdscanVolatility Foundation Volatility Framework 2.6.1**************************************************CommandProcess: csrss.exe Pid: 608CommandHistory: 0x11132d8 Application: cmd.exe Flags: Allocated, ResetCommandCount: 2 LastAdded: 1 LastDisplayed: 1FirstCommand: 0 CommandCountMax: 50ProcessHandle: 0x4c4Cmd #0 @ 0x4e1eb8: sc query malwarCmd #1 @ 0x11135e8: sc query malwareWe see sc query malware command was executed.  The sc command is used to configure, query, stop, start, delete, and add system services on the Windows command line.In our case, the command seems to be querying a service called malware. The first command entry looks like a typo though.Similar to cmdscan the consoles plugin finds commands that attackers typed into cmd.exe or executed via backdoors. The major advantage to this plugin is it not only prints the commands attackers typed, but it collects the entire screen buffer (input and output). For instance, lets see what output was generated when sc query malware command was executed.‚ûú  python2 vol.py -f malware.vmem --profile=WinXPSP2x86 consolesVolatility Foundation Volatility Framework 2.6.1**************************************************ConsoleProcess: csrss.exe Pid: 608Console: 0x4e2370 CommandHistorySize: 50HistoryBufferCount: 2 HistoryBufferMax: 4OriginalTitle: %SystemRoot%\\system32\\cmd.exeTitle: C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\cmd.exeAttachedProcess: cmd.exe Pid: 544 Handle: 0x4c4----CommandHistory: 0x1113498 Application: sc.exe Flags:CommandCount: 0 LastAdded: -1 LastDisplayed: -1FirstCommand: 0 CommandCountMax: 50ProcessHandle: 0x0----CommandHistory: 0x11132d8 Application: cmd.exe Flags: Allocated, ResetCommandCount: 2 LastAdded: 1 LastDisplayed: 1FirstCommand: 0 CommandCountMax: 50ProcessHandle: 0x4c4Cmd #0 at 0x4e1eb8: sc query malwarCmd #1 at 0x11135e8: sc query malware----Screen 0x4e2a70 X:80 Y:300Dump:Microsoft Windows XP [Version 5.1.2600](C) Copyright 1985-2001 Microsoft Corp.C:\\Documents and Settings\\Administrator&gt;sc query malwar[SC] EnumQueryServicesStatus:OpenService FAILED 1060:The specified service does not exist as an installed service.C:\\Documents and Settings\\Administrator&gt;sc query malwareSERVICE_NAME: malware        TYPE               : 1  KERNEL_DRIVER        STATE              : 4  RUNNING                                (STOPPABLE,NOT_PAUSABLE,IGNORES_SHUTDOWN)        WIN32_EXIT_CODE    : 0  (0x0)        SERVICE_EXIT_CODE  : 0  (0x0)        CHECKPOINT         : 0x0        WAIT_HINT          : 0x0C:\\Documents and Settings\\Administrator&gt;More information about the service can be queried using the svcscan plugin.

This information can be found using the envars plugin. Typically this will show the number of CPUs installed and the hardware architecture (though the kdbgscan output is a much more reliable source), the process‚Äôs current directory, temporary directory, session name, computer name, user name, and various other interesting artifacts.But what really triggered PID 1956? My hypothesis was that the user opened suspicious PDF documents that led to cmd &amp; Adobe reader spawning. We also saw a network connection linked to this process. Using the iehistory plugin we can recover fragments of IE history index.dat cache files. It can find basic accessed links (via FTP or HTTP), redirected links (‚ÄìREDR), and deleted entries (‚ÄìLEAK). It applies to any process which loads and uses the wininet.dll library, not just Internet Explorer. Typically that includes Windows Explorer and even malware samples. For more info about the same, you can read this blog postFrom the above, we see two suspicious pdf documents linked to the same process: listener.pdf &amp; Exploit.pdfLets scan for malicious drivers loaded, and moreso any that contains the malware string or name.‚ûú  python2 vol.py -f malware.vmem --profile=WinXPSP2x86 driverscan | grep \"malware\"Volatility Foundation Volatility Framework 2.6.1Offset(P)          #Ptr #Hnd Start                            Size Service Key          Name         Driver Name------------------ ---- ---- ------------------ ------------------ -------------------- ------------ -----------0x0000000001a498b8        3        0 0xf9eb4000     0x1500 malware              malware      \\Driver\\malwareTo extract a kernel driver to a file, use the moddump pluggin.

Doing a quick google search on the same, we still get hits on R2D2 backdoor.Lets find out if the dll is used by explorer.exe. To display a process‚Äôs loaded DLLs, use the dlllist plugin with the -p or --pid filter as shown below.From the output shown above, we see mfc42ul.dll has a wierd base address compared to the rest (0x10000000). What we can do is extract the DLL from the process‚Äôs memory space and dump it to disk for analysis as shown below:‚ûú  python2 vol.py -f malware.vmem --profile=WinXPSP2x86 moddump -b 0x10000000 --dump-dir=$PWDVolatility Foundation Volatility Framework 2.6.1Module Base Module Name          Result----------- -------------------- ------0x010000000 UNKNOWN              OK: driver.10000000.sys‚ûú  md5sum driver.10000000.sys4986f678160ccd516f2bd589719ea0c4  driver.10000000.sysDoing a quick check on VirusTotal, we see 46/68 flagged this file as malicious.I did some research on this backdoor and came across this report by the Chaos Computer Club (CCC), a long-established German hacker group that claimed that the German government may have unleashed a backdoor Trojan Horse program, allowing them to spy on its people. While running strings on the suspicious dll (mfc42ul.dll), i noticed some wierd string, C3PO-r2d2-POE. Starwars characters? I don‚Äôt know.From CCC‚Äôs report, i learnt that the backdoor was dubbed ‚ÄúR2D2‚Äù due to the ‚ÄúC3PO-r2d2-POE‚Äù string located inside the Trojan. CCC claims that it allows the monitoring Internet activity, including the recording of MSN Messenger conversations, Skype calls and Yahoo messenger chat.That wraps up my analysis of the R2D2 backdoor, atleast for the context of the CTF. Upon completion of my analysis, I stumbled upon several blog posts documenting analysis of the same sample. Please check them out!

    "content": "  The content of this post applies only to Universal Analytics property (UA), not Google Analytics 4 (GA 4). In addition, since UA is about to be deprecated on Jul 1, 2023, the Page Views feature of Chirpy will also be deprecated at that time.This post is to enable Page Views on the Chirpy theme based blog that you just built. This requires technical knowledge and it‚Äôs recommended to keep the google_analytics.pv.* empty unless you have a good reason. If your website has low traffic, the page views count would discourage you to write more blogs. With that said, let‚Äôs start with the setup.Set up Google AnalyticsCreate GA account and propertyFirst, you need to set up your account on Google analytics. While you create your account, you must create your first Property as well.  Head to https://analytics.google.com/ and click on Start Measuring  Enter your desired Account Name and choose the desired checkboxes  Enter your desired Property Name. This is the name of the tracker project that appears on your Google Analytics dashboard  Enter the required information About your business  Hit Create and accept any license popup to set up your Google Analytics account and create your propertyCreate Data StreamWith your property created, you now need to set up Data Stream to track your blog traffic. After you signup, the prompt should automatically take you to create your first Data Stream. If not, follow these steps:  Go to Admin on the left column  Select the desired property from the drop-down on the second column  Click on Data Streams  Add a stream and click on Web  Enter your blog‚Äôs URLIt should look like this:Now, click on the new data stream and grab the Measurement ID. It should look something like G-V6XXXXXXXX. Copy this to your _config.yml file:google_analytics:  id: 'G-V6XXXXXXX'   # fill in your Google Analytics ID  # Google Analytics pageviews report settings  pv:    proxy_endpoint:   # fill in the Google Analytics superProxy endpoint of Google App Engine    cache_path:       # the local PV cache data, friendly to visitors from GFW regionWhen you push these changes to your blog, you should start seeing the traffic on your Google Analytics. Play around with the Google Analytics dashboard to get familiar with the options available as it takes like 5 mins to pick up your changes. You should now be able to monitor your traffic in real time.Setup Page ViewsThere is a detailed tutorial available to set up Google Analytics superProxy. But, if you are interested to just quickly get your Chirpy-based blog display page views, follow along. These steps were tested on a Linux machine. If you are running Windows, you can use the Git bash terminal to run Unix-like commands.Setup Google App Engine      Visit https://console.cloud.google.com/appengine        Click on Create Application        Click on Create Project        Enter the name and choose the data center close to you        Select Python language and Standard environment        Enable billing account. Yeah, you have to link your credit card. But, you won‚Äôt be billed unless you exceed your free quota. For a simple blog, the free quota is more than sufficient.        Go to your App Engine dashboard on your browser and select API &amp; Services from the left navigation menu        Click on Enable APIs and Services button on the top        Enable the following APIs: Google Analytics API        On the left, Click on OAuth Consent Screen and accept Configure Consent Screen. Select External since your blog is probably hosted for the public. Click on Publish under Publishing Status        Click on Credentials on the left and create a new OAuth Client IDs credential. Make sure to add an entry under Authorized redirect URIs that matches: https://&lt;project-id&gt;.&lt;region&gt;.r.appspot.com/admin/auth        Note down the Your Client ID and Your Client Secret. You‚Äôll need this in the next section.

Remove the first 2 lines in the src/app.yaml file:    - application: your-project-id- version: 1            In src/config.py, add the OAUTH_CLIENT_ID and OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET that you gathered from your App Engine Dashboard.        Enter any random key for XSRF_KEY, your config.py should look similar to this    #!/usr/bin/python2.7__author__ = 'pete.frisella@gmail.com (Pete Frisella)'# OAuth 2.0 Client SettingsAUTH_CONFIG = {  'OAUTH_CLIENT_ID': 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID',  'OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET': 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET',  'OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI': '%s%s' % (    'https://chirpy-test-XXXXXX.ue.r.appspot.com',    '/admin/auth'  )}# XSRF SettingsXSRF_KEY = 'OnceUponATimeThereLivedALegend'              You can configure a custom domain instead of https://PROJECT_ID.REGION_ID.r.appspot.com.But, for the sake of keeping it simple, we will be using the Google provided default URL.

Add a /admin to the end of the URL.        Click on Authorize Users and make sure to add yourself as a managed user.        If you get any errors, please Google it. The errors are self-explanatory and should be easy to fix.  If everything went good, you‚Äôll get this screen:Create Google Analytics QueryHead to https://PROJECT_ID.REGION_ID.r.appspot.com/admin and create a query after verifying the account. GA Core Reporting API query request can be created in Query Explorer.The query parameters are as follows:  start-date: fill in the first day of blog posting  end-date: fill in today (this is a parameter supported by GA Report, which means that it will always end according to the current query date)  metrics: select ga:pageviews  dimensions: select ga:pagePathIn order to reduce the returned results and reduce the network bandwidth, we add custom filtering rules 1:      filters: fill in ga:pagePath=~^/posts/.*/$;ga:pagePath!@=.    Among them, ; means using logical AND to concatenate two rules.    If the site.baseurl is specified, change the first filtering rule to ga:pagePath=~^/BASE_URL/posts/.*/$, where BASE_URL is the value of site.baseurl.  After Run Query, copy the generated contents of API Query URI at the bottom of the page and fill in the Encoded URI for the query of SuperProxy on GAE.After the query is saved on GAE, a Public Endpoint (public access address) will be generated, and we will get the query result in JSON format when accessing it. Finally, click Enable Endpoint in Public Request Endpoint to make the query effective, and click Start Scheduling in Scheduling to start the scheduled task.Configure Chirpy to Display Page ViewOnce all the hard part is done, it is very easy to enable the Page View on Chirpy theme. Your superProxy dashboard should look something like below and you can grab the required values.Update the _config.yml file of Chirpy project with the values from your dashboard, to look similar to the following:google_analytics:  id: 'G-V6XXXXXXX'   # fill in your Google Analytics ID  pv:    proxy_endpoint: 'https://PROJECT_ID.REGION_ID.r.appspot.com/query?id=&lt;ID FROM SUPER PROXY&gt;'    cache_path:       # the local PV cache data, friendly to visitors from GFW regionNow, you should see the Page View enabled on your blog.Reference            Google Analytics Core Reporting API: Filters¬†&#8617;      "

    "content": "This post will guide you how to write a post on Chirpy theme. Even if you have previous experience with Jekyll, this article is worth reading, because many features require specific variables to be set.Naming and PathCreate a new file named YYYY-MM-DD-TITLE.EXTENSION and put it in the _posts of the root directory. Please note that the EXTENSION must be one of md and markdown. If you want to save time of creating files, please consider using the plugin Jekyll-Compose to accomplish this.Front MatterBasically, you need to fill the Front Matter as below at the top of the post:---title: TITLEdate: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS +/-TTTTcategories: [TOP_CATEGORIE, SUB_CATEGORIE]tags: [TAG]     # TAG names should always be lowercase---  The posts‚Äô layout has been set to post by default, so there is no need to add the variable layout in the Front Matter block.Timezone of DateIn order to accurately record the release date of a post, you should not only set up the timezone of _config.yml but also provide the post‚Äôs timezone in variable date of its Front Matter block. Format: +/-TTTT, e.g. +0800.Categories and TagsThe categories of each post are designed to contain up to two elements, and the number of elements in tags can be zero to infinity. For instance:---categories: [Animal, Insect]tags: [bee]---Author InformationThe author information of the post usually does not need to be filled in the Front Matter , they will be obtained from variables social.name and the first entry of social.links of the configuration file by default. But you can also override it as follows:Adding author information in _data/authors.yml (If your website doesn‚Äôt have this file, don‚Äôt hesitate to create one).&lt;author_id&gt;:  name: &lt;full name&gt;  twitter: &lt;twitter_of_author&gt;  url: &lt;homepage_of_author&gt;And then use author to specify a single entry or authors to specify multiple entries:---author: &lt;author_id&gt;                     # for single entry# orauthors: [&lt;author1_id&gt;, &lt;author2_id&gt;]   # for multiple entries---Having said that, the key author can also identify multiple entries.  The benefit of reading the author information from the file _data/authors.yml is that the page will have the meta tag twitter:creator, which enriches the Twitter Cards and is good for SEO.Table of ContentsBy default, the Table of Contents (TOC) is displayed on the right panel of the post. If you want to turn it off globally, go to _config.yml and set the value of variable toc to false. If you want to turn off TOC for a specific post, add the following to the post‚Äôs Front Matter:---toc: false---CommentsThe global switch of comments is defined by variable comments.active in the file _config.yml. After selecting a comment system for this variable, comments will be turned on for all posts.If you want to close the comment for a specific post, add the following to the Front Matter of the post:---comments: false---MathematicsFor website performance reasons, the mathematical feature won‚Äôt be loaded by default. But it can be enabled by:---math: true---MermaidMermaid is a great diagrams generation tool. To enable it on your post, add the following to the YAML block:---mermaid: true---Then you can use it like other markdown languages: surround the graph code with ```mermaid and ```.ImagesCaptionAdd italics to the next line of an imageÔºåthen it will become the caption and appear at the bottom of the image:![img-description](/path/to/image)_Image Caption_SizeIn order to prevent the page content layout from shifting when the image is loaded, we should set the width and height for each image:![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: width=\"700\" height=\"400\" }Starting from Chirpy v5.0.0, height and width support abbreviations (height ‚Üí h, width ‚Üí w). The following example has the same effect as the above:![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: w=\"700\" h=\"400\" }PositionBy default, the image is centered, but you can specify the position by using one of the classes normal, left, and right.  Once the position is specified, the image caption should not be added.      Normal position    Image will be left aligned in below sample:    ![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .normal }            Float to the left    ![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .left }            Float to the right    ![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .right }      ShadowThe screenshots of the program window can be considered to show the shadow effect, and the shadow will be visible in the light mode:![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .shadow }CDN URLIf you host the images on the CDN, you can save the time of repeatedly writing the CDN URL by assigning the variable img_cdn of _config.yml file:img_cdn: https://cdn.comOnce img_cdn is assigned, the CDN URL will be added to the path of all images (images of site avatar and posts) starting with /.For instance, when using images:![The flower](/path/to/flower.png)The parsing result will automatically add the CDN prefix https://cdn.com before the image path:&lt;img src=\"https://cdn.com/path/to/flower.png\" alt=\"The flower\"&gt;Image PathWhen a post contains many images, it will be a time-consuming task to repeatedly define the path of the images. To solve this, we can define this path in the YAML block of the post:---img_path: /img/path/---And then, the image source of Markdown can write the file name directly:![The flower](flower.png)The output will be:&lt;img src=\"/img/path/flower.png\" alt=\"The flower\"&gt;Preview ImageIf you want to add an image to the top of the post contents, specify the attribute path, width, height, and alt for the image:---image:  path: /path/to/image  width: 1000   # in pixels  height: 400   # in pixels  alt: image alternative text---Except for alt, all other options are necessary, especially the width and height, which are related to user experience and web page loading performance. The above section ‚ÄúSize‚Äù also mentions this.Starting from Chirpy v5.0.0, the attributes height and width can be abbreviated: height ‚Üí h, width ‚Üí w. In addition, the img_path can also be passed to the preview image, that is, when it has been set, the  attribute path only needs the image file name.For simple use, you can also just use image to define the path.image: /path/to/imagePinned PostsYou can pin one or more posts to the top of the home page, and the fixed posts are sorted in reverse order according to their release date. Enable by:---pin: true---PromptsThere are several types of prompts: tip, info, warning, and danger. They can be generated by adding the class prompt-{type} to the blockquote. For example, define a prompt of type info as follows:&gt; Example line for prompt.{: .prompt-info }SyntaxInline Code`inline code part`Filepath Hightlight`/path/to/a/file.extend`{: .filepath}Code BlockMarkdown symbols ``` can easily create a code block as follows:```This is a plaintext code snippet.```Specifying LanguageUsing ```{language} you will get a code block with syntax highlight:```yamlkey: value```  The Jekyll tag {% highlight %} is not compatible with this theme.Line NumberBy default, all languages except plaintext, console, and terminal will display line numbers. When you want to hide the line number of a code block, add the class nolineno to it:```shellecho 'No more line numbers!'```{: .nolineno }Specifying the FilenameYou may have noticed that the code language will be displayed at the top of the code block. If you want to replace it with the file name, you can add the attribute file to achieve this:```shell# content```{: file=\"path/to/file\" }Liquid CodesIf you want to display the Liquid snippet, surround the liquid code with {% raw %} and {% endraw %}:{% raw %}```liquid{% if product.title contains 'Pack' %}  This product's title contains the word Pack.{% endif %}```{% endraw %}Or adding render_with_liquid: false (Requires Jekyll 4.0 or higher) to the post‚Äôs YAML block.Learn MoreFor more knowledge about Jekyll posts, visit the Jekyll Docs: Posts."
